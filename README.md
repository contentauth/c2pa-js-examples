# c2pa-js/examples

> [!WARNING]
> These examples use the OLD JavaScript library and are deprecated.  The current library is [c2pa-js](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js).

Please see the [example documentation](https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/js-sdk/guides/examples).

This directory contains examples that are managed by the [Rush](https://rushjs.io/) monorepo manager to support automatic workspace linking. Interact with the examples by using the `rushx` command to run their scripts. 

If you'd like to use the examples in a tooling-agnostic context (for use with `npm`, `yarn`, etc.), they are transformed and mirrored here: https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js-examples
